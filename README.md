# snapdata-parser
Parse Snapdata's proprietary format.

A friend of mine acquired a law firm, which used format called Snapdata as a mail merge / contact database. Apparently the company was founded by a guy named Scott Campbell, who luck would have it, was retiring and the new owner Daniel (daniel@snapdone.com) was jerking customers around. When we called to transfer the product license, they balked, when we sought options for the exporting of the contacts, they also balked. Basically, they dicked around with a decade old customer and scoffed at a potential new customer, over apparently a $300 license. In the end, we wasted a bunch of time so it was necessary to write a parser for the Snap "cards" to export the content to csv. And trash the tool completely.
